# [Material-UI](http://callemall.github.io/material-ui/)

Material-UI is a CSS framework and a set of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) components that implement [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) specification.

Check out our [documentation site](http://www.material-ui.com/) for live examples. It's still a work in progress, but hopefully you can see where we're headed.

## Installation

Material-UI is available as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/material-ui).
```sh
npm install material-ui
```

Use [browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [reactify](https://github.com/andreypopp/reactify) for dependency management and JSX transformation. The CSS framework is written in [Less](http://lesscss.org/), so you'll need to compile that as well.


## Usage

Once material-ui is included in your project, you can use the components this way:
```js
var React = require('react'),
  mui = require('material-ui'),
  RaisedButton = mui.RaisedButton;

var SomeAwesomeComponent = React.createClass({

  render: function() {
    return (
    	<RaisedButton label="Default" />
    );
  }

});

module.exports = SomeAwesomeComponent;
```

### Usage Notes
Some components uses [react-tap-event-plugin](https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin) to
listen for touch events. This dependency is temporary and will go away once react v1.0 is released. Until then, be
sure to inject this plugin at the start of your app.
```js
var injectTapEventPlugin = require("react-tap-event-plugin");

//Needed for onTouchTap
//Can go away when react 1.0 release
//Check this repo:
//https://github.com/zilverline/react-tap-event-plugin
injectTapEventPlugin();
```

## Customization

The styles are separated into 2 less files:
* src/less/scaffolding.less
* src/less/components.less

This allows you to override any variables defined in [custom-variables.less](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/master/src/less/variables/custom-variables.less) without having to modify material-ui source files directly. For example, your main.less file could look something like this:
```css
@import "node_modules/material-ui/src/less/scaffolding.less";

//Define a custom less file to override any variables defined in scaffolding.less
@import "my-custom-overrides.less";

@import "node_modules/material-ui/src/less/components.less";
```

### Use with Sass

For [Sass](http://www.sass-lang.com) users, [material-ui-sass](https://github.com/gpbl/material-ui-sass) contains the .scss version of the Less framework.

## Examples
There are 2 projects that you can look at to help you get started. The first project can be found in the [example folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/example). This is a basic project that shows how you can consume material-ui components in your own project.

The second project is the actual documentation site. This is a more complex project but will give examples of every component. Check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs) for build instructions.

## Contribute

[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) came about from our love of [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Google's Material Design](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html). We're currently using it on a project at [Call-Em-All](https://www.call-em-all.com/) and plan on adding to it and making it better. If you'd like to help, check out the [docs folder](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/tree/master/docs). We'd greatly appreciate any contribution you make. :)
